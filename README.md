# PAP
In this repository i have all the files and code used to make my PAP (Prova de Apitd√£o Profissional) which is the final project students who are undergoing high school on a particular course have to do to finish high school, like the exams.


My PAP is based around cybersecurity, here i set up a small local network with 3 virtual machines, one acting as the attacker, Kali Linux, another acting as the client, Windows 10 and an ubuntu server where i hosted the websites i created.

I made 2 different attacks to this network, the first one was a "MITM (Man-In-The-Middle)" where the goal was to find the address of the website which the client was acessing, IronLockBank, and the other attack was a "Spear-Pishing", where i targeted the account that the client (fernandomendesbanco@gmail.com) had on the Bank.

This is a super short version of my project, ANY TIPS or RECOMMENDATIONS about my project or about cybersecurity are apreciated, you can reach me at alexandreadrianofranco@gmail.com .

Thank You.
