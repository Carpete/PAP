PAP
In this repository, I have all the files and code used to create my PAP (Prova de Aptid√£o Profissional), which is the final project that high school students in a particular course have to complete in order to finish high school, similar to exams.

My PAP is based on cybersecurity. Here, I set up a small local network with three virtual machines: one acting as the attacker (Kali Linux), another as the client (Windows 10), and an Ubuntu server where I hosted the websites I created.

I performed two different attacks on this network. The first one was a 'MITM (Man-In-The-Middle)' attack, where the goal was to find the address of the website that the client was accessing, IronLockBank. The other attack was a 'Spear-Phishing' attack, where I targeted the account that the client (fernandomendesbanco@gmail.com) had with the bank.

This is just a brief overview of my project. Any tips or recommendations about my project or cybersecurity are appreciated. You can reach me at alexandreadrianofranco@gmail.com.

Thank you.
